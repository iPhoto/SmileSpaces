# Web Server Backend

# iOS Application
iOS application as a location mobile service has a main View with the map of the city ( depending on the version of the App ). In this view you'll be able to have a global sightseing of every zone with a smile/color indicating the happiness of zone. From this view you'll be able to open more details of the zone ( touching in the zone pin ) or share your feeling in the place where you are.

3. After, execute from terminal `pod install` ( be sure you are in the iOS project folder in terminal )
4. If everything goes well you should open the project **from .xcworkspace** file.
